 * input and per output, as thick as mempool draws that strand, with a block for
 * the coin at its outer end. The ribbons meet in one glass collar, because a
 * transaction spends its inputs together; their order does not say which input
 * paid which output.
 *
 * Positions come from a 1500 × 600 canvas with mempool's band of up to 100 px;
 * one scene unit is 100 px. x runs from inputs to outputs, y is up.
